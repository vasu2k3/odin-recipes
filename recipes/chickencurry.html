    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe is for a mildly spiced chicken curry from Burma with a beautiful fish-infused sauce! Try it! Garam masala can be found in most supermarkets' spice sections or at Indian markets. You can also easily make your own. This meal is excellent served with rice and Indian breads such as chapati, roti, or naan.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>2 onions, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>5 teaspoons corn oil</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced lemongrass</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub chicken thighs with curry powder, salt, and garam masala; cover and set aside. Combine onions, 2 tablespoons water, garlic, paprika, ginger, and cayenne pepper in a blender; blend into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large, lidded skillet over medium heat. Add onion-spice paste; cook and stir until darkened, about 7 minutes. Stir in chicken thighs; cook 3 to 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, fish sauce, and lemongrass; cook 2 minutes. Stir in 1 cup water; bring to a boil. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low; cook until chicken begins to fall apart, stirring occasionally, 25 to 35 minutes. Uncover skillet; increase heat and cook until sauce is reduced, about 5 minutes. Skim and discard excess oil from top.</li>
